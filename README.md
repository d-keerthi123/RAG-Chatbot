# 🤖 RAG Chatbot

A simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built using LangChain and Ollama.  
The chatbot retrieves relevant information from documents and generates answers using a local LLM powered by Ollama .

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User uploads a **PDF document**
2. Text is extracted using **pdfplumber**
3. The document is split into **smaller chunks**
4. Each chunk is converted into **vector embeddings**
5. Embeddings are stored in a **FAISS vector database**
6. When a user asks a question:
   - Relevant chunks are retrieved using **similarity search**
   - Context + question are passed to the **LLM**
7. The **LLM generates a final answer**
